# qr-geoloc
Tools for the geolocation of QRcode-tagged items based on a video stream.

These works were part of the project Rain of Music, which aims to create a scenography that could be performed by terrestrial robots and/or aerial drones on a scene in front of a public.
The QR geolocation takes place as a way to determine the localization (e.g. : position and orientation within a plane) of different independant items identified by a visible QR code.
